# Comparing location data from smartphone and dedicated GPS devices: Implications for epidemiological research

## Abstract

The purpose of this paper is to compare location data from a dedicated Global Positioning Systems (GPS) device with location data from smartphones. Data from the INTerventions, Equity, and Action in Cities Team (INTERACT), a Canada-wide study examining the impacts of urban form changes on health in Victoria, Vancouver, Saskatoon, and Montreal, were used. A total of 337 participants contributed data from the Ethica Data smartphone app and the SenseDoc dedicated GPS. Participants recorded an average total of 14,781 Ethica locations (SD=19,353) and 197,167 SenseDoc locations (SD=111,868). Dynamic time warping was used to examine spatial and temporal similarity of GPS point time sequences. Three activity space measures, a convex hull, a 2-standard deviation ellipse, and 500meter radius circular buffers around points, derived the smartphone and dedicated GPS device were compared. The analysis shows that if the outcome data are available at the day or survey level, there may only be small differences in observed associations between exposure and outcome whether using dedicated GPS or smartphone location data. However, if the exposure and outcome data are summarized and analyzed at the hour or minute frequency, dedicated GPS and smartphone devices are likely to provide different substantially different estimates of exposure.
