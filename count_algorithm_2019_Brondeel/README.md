### Abstract

Background: Closed source software for treating accelerometer data, such as the frequently used ActiLife program for activity counts, limits the knowledge of the algorithms transforming acceleration data into physical activity indicators. Recently, an algorithm was developed in MATLAB that replicates the ActiLife activity counts. The aim of this study was (1) to translate the MATLAB algorithm into R and Python; and (2) to test the accuracy of the algorithm on free-living data.

Methods: As part of the INTERACT study (INTErventions, Research, and Action in Cities Team), data was collected from 86 participants in Victoria, Canada. The participants were asked to wear an integrated GPS and accelerometer sensor (SenseDoc) during 10 days on the right hip. Raw accelerometer data was processed in ActiLife, Matlab, R and Python.

Results: Data was collected for a combined 749 valid days (≥ 10 hours wear time). MATLAB, Python and R CPM on the vertical axis had Pearson correlations with the ActiLife CPM of 0.998, 0.998, and 0.999, respectively. All three algorithms overestimated somewhat ActiLife CPM by up to 2.8%.

Conclusions: A MATLAB algorithm for deriving ActiLife counts was replicated in R and Python, and the coding languages can be used interchangeably. This opens up possibilities to comparing studies using similar accelerometers from different companies, and to using free open-source software.
