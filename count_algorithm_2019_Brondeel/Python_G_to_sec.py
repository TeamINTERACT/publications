Script with article: 
Converting raw accelerometer data to activity counts 
using open source code in Matlab, Python, and R ? a comparison to ActiLife activity counts
Corresponding author Ruben Brondeel (ruben.brondeel@umontreal.ca)

This script calculates the Python version of activity counts, 
The functions are a translation of the Matlab function presented in 
Br?nd JC, Andersen LB, Arvidsson D. Generating ActiGraph Counts from 
Raw Acceleration Recorded by an Alternative Monitor. Med Sci Sports Exerc. 2017.

Python (3.6); run in Eclipse (Oxygen.3a Release (4.7.3a))
